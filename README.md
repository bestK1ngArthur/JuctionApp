# Takto App

The mobile recommender app to find the most suitable place to have meal with friends. 

### Algorithm
1. A group leader opens Takto App and sends a link to friends he wants to invite to dinner.
2. Then the leader and friends are invited to go through a very simple vote. Each member of the group several times chooses the best restaurant from the two offered by our system.
3. When the recommendation system decides that it has figured out all the necessary information from the user, the voting ends and the user waits until the rest of the group members finish voting.
4. When the last friend has passed the vote, the system will offer everyone the same list of recommendations for places to eat.
